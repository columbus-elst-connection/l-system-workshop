# workshop
A comprehensive collection of all things related to the workshop

## Collecting the material
There is a `Makefile` in this directory that collects all the material in an
archive and compresses that.

```sh
make
```

Will start the process. Cleaning up the created artifacts can be done with the
following command

```sh
make clean
```
