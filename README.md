A comprehensive collection of all things related to the workshop

## Collecting the material
There is a `Makefile` in this directory that collects all the material in an
archive and compressed that.

make
```

Will start of the process. Cleanup up the created artifacts can be done with the
following command

```sh
make clean
```
