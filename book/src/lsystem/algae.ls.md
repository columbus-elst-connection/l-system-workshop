# algae.ls
Take a look at the `systems/algae.ls` file. For convenience it is reproduced
here

```plain
config:
step = 100
angle = 45

rules:
axiom  = A
A => AB
B => A
```

Does this look familiar?

## Rules
Take a closer look at the `rules` section. It defines an axiom just as in the
preceding chapter.

Furthermore it defines two rules. The first rule `A => AB` tells us to replace
every symbol `A` with its _production_ `AB`. The last rule `B => A` tells us to
replace each symbol `B` with the production `A`.
This is exactly like the rules in the preceding chapter.

## cargo run
Go into the `code` directory and run the following command

```sh
cargo run -- -f system/algae.ls -n 0
```

It should respond with `A`. Below the sequence of words generated by the
L-system from the preceding chapter is reproduced.

1. *A*
2. *AB*
3. *ABA*
4. *ABAAB*

Change the `-n` parameter in the call to cargo run and check if it corresponds
with the above sequence.

## Exercices
1. Check other values for the number of iterations.
2. check out `cargo run -- --help`.
