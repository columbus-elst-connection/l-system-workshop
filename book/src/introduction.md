# Introduction
This book is a compendium to the [L-systems][l-system] workshop.

This book and the workshop will introduce you to L-systems, allowing you to play
and understand them.

Understanding means that you get the opportunity to create a program that reads,
evaluates and renders an L-system. We will start from scratch and teach you all
the necessary tools and techniques to finish.

This book serves as a guide during your journey. A trusty companion that cheers
you on, helps you when you are stuck and can turn to when your motivation is
low.

## Not at a workshop?
This book is written to be self contained. The only downside of not being in a
workshop is missing the ability to ask questions and getting a quick answer.

There still is the ability to ask questions, it might just take some time before
we can answer them. Try one of the following means of communication
