# Interpreter
In the Parser section we created a parser for `.ls` files that could return a
L-system data structure. We would now like to interpret this data structure in
order to evolve the L-system a number of iterations.

The Interpreter section will guide use along that path and describes how to
create software that can interpret our L-system and evolve the start word.

Make sure to look in to [working with dependencies][dependencies] to find out
how to incorporate your code into the project.
