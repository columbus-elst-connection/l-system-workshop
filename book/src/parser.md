# Parser
In the L-system section you have had the opportunity to learn about and play with
Lindenmayer systems. The Parser section starts our journey of creating our own
software to explore L-systems.

The journey starts with teaching the computer about `.ls` files and what we
describe with them. 

Make sure to look in to [working with dependencies][dependencies] to find out
how to incorporate your code into the project.
