# Contributors
This workshop is not created in a vacuum. To start Phil Friedman and Daan van Berkel invested their time to understand L-systems and write code to explore them.

Both Phil and Daan are able to invest their time because their families and friends allow them to focus on creating a workshop instead of spending time with them. These people are the hidden enablers and they are deeply thanked.

## Workshop Participants
This workshop was held at different conferences and every time a worthwhile experience. Being able to go infront of a room and see people engaged in material, sharing and discussing is immensly gratifying. We thank everybody that joined us in our exploration of this interesting topic.

## Suggestions
A lot of people had great suggestions and a lot of them ended up in the material. Unfortunatly these heroes weren't properly registered in any way. We thank you none the less.
