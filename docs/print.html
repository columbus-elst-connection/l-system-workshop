<p>This book is a compendium to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> workshop.</p>
<p>This book and the workshop will introduce you to L-systems, allowing you to play
and understand them.</p>
<p>Understanding means that you get the opportunity to create a program that reads,
evaluates and renders an L-system. We will start from scratch and teach you all
the necessary tools and techniques to finish.</p>
<p>This book serves as a guide during your journey. A trusty companion that cheers
you on, helps you when you are stuck and can turn to when your motivation is
low.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#not-at-a-workshop" id="not-at-a-workshop">Not at a workshop?</a></h2>
<p>This book is written to be self contained. The only downside of not being in a
workshop is missing the ability to ask questions and getting a quick answer.</p>
<p>There still is the ability to ask questions, it might just take some time before
we can answer them. Try one of the following means of communication</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#outline" id="outline">Outline</a></h1>
<p>There are various ways of learning and we want to enable you to choose your path
through the material. Below you can find the main sections that we will address
during this workshop.</p>
<p>It is possible to progress through the sections in any order you want. We have
setup things in such a way that you can rely on our code so long as yours is not
ready.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#l-systems" id="l-systems">L-systems</a></h2>
<p>This section teaches you what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> are, trains you how to
create them, and allows you to play with them.</p>
<p>Describing a L-system is one thing. Teaching a computer how to work with
L-systems is another. The next sections are major parts in the software that
allows you to explore L-systems.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#parser" id="parser">Parser</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parser</a> is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data
structure ‚Äì often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other
hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while
checking for correct syntax. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section focuses on parsing a L-system. We do this by creating our own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">Parser Combinator framework</a> that we use to read an L-system
and turn it into a data structure that we can use.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#interpreter" id="interpreter">Interpreter</a></h2>
<p>Once you have defined an L-system, you probably would like to do something with
it. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a> helps with this goal. It diligently executes the
instructions described by the L-system informing interested parties what has
happened.</p>
<p>The interpreter is the workhorse of our program. Although it is the centerpiece
of our software, it is a quit simple machine.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#renderer" id="renderer">Renderer</a></h2>
<p>An L-system without a &quot;picture&quot; is as a Christmas tree without decorations. It
still is instructive, but is sure isn't as much fun.</p>
<p>In this section we explore various way of make a &quot;picture&quot; for our L-system.
There are various ways of turning the L-system into meaningful artifact. Making
an image is surely not the only one.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#l-system" id="l-system">L-system</a></h1>
<p>This section teaches you all about what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> are.</p>
<p>Read about Aristid Lindenmayer and why he invented his system. Explore the rich
language and it's beautiful images.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#aristid-lindenmayer" id="aristid-lindenmayer">Aristid Lindenmayer</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristid_Lindenmayer">Aristid Lindenmayer</a> was a Hungarian biologist. He lived from 1925
until 1989. He studied biology and chemistry at the university of Budapest.
Lindenmayer got his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan before accepting a
position as professor in Philosophy of Life Sciences and Biology at the
University of Utrecht.</p>
<p><img src="lsystem//image/lindenmayer.jpg" alt="Aristid Lindenmayer" /></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#algae" id="algae">Algae</a></h1>
<p>Aristid Lindenmayer introduces a system of substitutions that would later bear
his name. He did this in a set of two articles; <em>Mathematical Models for
Cellular Interactions in Development</em>. As the title implies it offers a
mathematical theory to model growth in certain type of cells. Stripping away the
mathematics his article described an example that modeled algae. A more modern
description follows below.</p>
<p>We will study <em>words</em>, i.e. a sequence of symbols, over an <em>alphabet</em>. In our
example we take our alphabet to be the symbols <em>A</em>, and <em>B</em>. We will examine a
series of words. In the algae example we are starting with the word <em>A</em>, it is
our <em>axiom</em>.
With the current word in the series, we replace each symbol with a sequence of
symbols and concatenating the sub-sequences in a new word. In our example we
will replace each occurring symbol <em>A</em> with the sequence <em>AB</em>, and each
occurring symbol <em>B</em> with the sequence <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>Below you find the first few iterations of this process.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A</em>, our starting word.</li>
<li><em>AB</em>, because the single <em>A</em> is replaced with <em>AB</em>.</li>
<li><em>ABA</em>, because the single <em>A</em> is replaced with <em>AB</em> and the <em>B</em> is replaced with <em>A</em>.</li>
<li><em>ABAAB</em>, because each <em>A</em> is replaced with <em>AB</em> and each <em>B</em> is replaced with <em>A</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the above model the symbol <em>A</em> is a model for a mature cell, ready to divide
itself. The division however is asymmetric. It allows the original cell to
comfortable remain in place, making place for a young cell <em>B</em>. In its stead,
the young cell <em>B</em> first must mature to and become an <em>A</em> cell before it can
start reproducing itself.</p>
<p>Although this is a simple model. A lot can be learned from this. For an few
examples, see the exercises.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises" id="exercises">Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Extend the example with the a few iterations.</li>
<li>Count the number of symbols in each word of the series. Guess what number comes next.</li>
<li>Count the number of <em>A</em>'s and the number of <em>B</em>'s separately. What do you get.</li>
<li>We will number the words in our series, \(W_{0}\) for our start word, \(W_{1}\), for the next, \(W_{2}\) for the one after that, etcetera. Pick any number, let's say 4. Notice how \(W_{4}\), i.e. <em>ABAAB</em> is the concatenation of <em>ABA</em>, which is \(W_{3}\), and <em>AB</em>, which is \(W_{2}\). In other words \(W_{4}=W_{3}W_{2}\).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Check if something similar holds for \(W_{3}\) and \(W_{5}\).</li>
<li>Does this property, i.e. \(W_{k} = W_{k-1}W_{k-2}\) always hold?</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#algaels" id="algaels">algae.ls</a></h1>
<p>Take a look at the <code>systems/algae.ls</code> file. For convenience it is reproduced
here</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">config:
step = 100
angle = 45

rules:
axiom  = A
A =&gt; AB
B =&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>This this look familiar?</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rules" id="rules">Rules</a></h2>
<p>Take a closer look at the <code>rules</code> section. It defines an axiom just in the
preceding chapter.</p>
<p>Furthermore it defines two rules. The first rule <code>A =&gt; AB</code> tells us to replace
every symbol <code>A</code> with its <em>production</em> <code>AB</code>. The last rule <code>B =&gt; A</code> tells us to
replace each symbol <code>B</code> with the production <code>A</code>.
This is exactly like the rules in the preceding chapter.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#cargo-run" id="cargo-run">cargo run</a></h2>
<p>Go into the <code>code</code> directory and run the following command</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo run -- -f system/algae.ls -n 0
</code></pre>
<p>It should respond with <code>A</code>. Below the sequence of words generated by the
L-system from the preceding chapter is reproduced.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A</em></li>
<li><em>AB</em></li>
<li><em>ABA</em></li>
<li><em>ABAAB</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Change the <code>-n</code> parameter in the call to cargo run and check if it corresponds
with the above sequence.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercices" id="exercices">Exercices</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Check other values for the number of iterations.</li>
<li>check out <code>cargo run -- --help</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#kochls" id="kochls">koch.ls</a></h1>
<p>You may have noticed a different L-system in the <code>system</code> directory. I.e.
<code>koch.ls</code>. It is reproduced here for convenience.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">config:
step = 5
angle = 60

rules:
axiom = F
F =&gt; F-F++F-F

<p>L-systems would still be worthwhile if the output is only a sequence of symbols.
But it really shines when these symbols are interpreted as a description of a
image.</p>
<p>Let's make that possible. Open the <code>src/main.rs</code>file. You don't need to
understand any of this, we will explain all of it during this workshop.</p>
<p>There are a few comments instructing to <em>uncomment</em> certain lines to use the
crab renderer, what ever that should be.
Do that now and then run the following command</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo run -- -f system/koch.ls -n 4

<h1><a class="header" href="#config" id="config">config</a></h1>
<p>While playing with different number of iterations for the Koch L-system. You
probably noticed that sometimes the image would be drawn outside the borders of
the screen.</p>
<p>For example, the command </p>
<pre><code>cargo run -- -f system/koch.ls -n 5
</code></pre>
<p>Will result in a picture similar to the one below.</p>
<p><img src="lsystem//image/koch-cutoff.png" alt="The Koch curve drawn outside the boundary" /></p>
<p>The <code>config</code> section in <code>koch.ls</code> will be enable us to remedy that.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#step" id="step">step</a></h2>
<p>The config section has a number of key value pairs. One of them is <code>step</code>. This
controls how big the line segment is whenever line segment is drawn. When you
change it to <code>2</code> and run the the command above, we will capture the Koch curve
inside the window.</p>
<p><img src="lsystem//image/koch.png" alt="The Koch curve in full glory" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#angle" id="angle">angle</a></h2>
<p>There is an other option you can configure. I.e. <code>angle</code>. This determines the
number of degrees through which a turn is made. Change the configuration to have
a step of <code>30</code> and an angle of <code>80</code>. Next run the L-system for 4 iterations. </p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#config-1" id="config-1">config</a></h2>
<p>Begin with a <code>config</code> header. As you know this starts the configuration section
where you can configure the generation of the image. Configure the step to be
<code>5</code> and the angle to be <code>25</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">config:
step = 5
angle = 25
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rules-1" id="rules-1">rules</a></h2>
<p>Next comes the rules section which is started with a <code>rules</code> header. The first
thing in a rules section should be the <em>axiom</em>. Make this to be <code>--X</code>.
The axiom is followed by a number of rules. For this L-system there are two. One
rule that tells us to transform <code>F</code> into <code>FF</code>. The other rule tells us to
transform <code>X</code> into <code>F-[[X]+X]+F[+FX]-X</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">rules:

<h2><a class="header" href="#ferris-the-crab" id="ferris-the-crab">Ferris the Crab</a></h2>
<p><img src="lsystem//image/ferris.jpeg" alt="Ferris the Crab" />
The artist is <a href="https://twitter.com/whoisaldeka">@whoisaldeka</a>.</p>
<p>We all know and love Ferris. But did you know that Ferris is a skilled and
attentive artist. Ferris is willing to lend their skill for our workshop. By
listening to our instructions they will draw an image for us.</p>
<p>Below are the command that Ferris responds to. Each command has a
corresponding symbol that Ferris knows, understands and responds to.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#forward-f" id="forward-f">Forward <code>F</code></a></h3>
<p>The forward command will make Ferris take a step forward, leaving a line in
their trail. The step size is determined by the <code>step</code> value of the
configuration.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#turnleft-" id="turnleft-">TurnLeft <code>+</code></a></h3>
<p>When the turn left command is issued Ferris will change heading accordingly. The
angle through which Ferris will turn is configured with the <code>angle</code> value of the
configuration.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#turnright--" id="turnright--">TurnRight <code>-</code></a></h3>
<p>Correspondingly, Ferris knows about how to turn right.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#push-" id="push-">Push <code>[</code></a></h3>
<p>Not only is Ferris a great artist, they have excellent memory. With the push
command Ferris will remember their position and heading so that they are able to
come back to it at a later time, i.e. when the corresponding pop command is
issued.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pop-" id="pop-">Pop <code>]</code></a></h3>
<p>What would push be without a pop? Ferris agrees and will respond to the pop
command by remembering position and heading from the corresponding push command.
Push and pop commands should properly match. Just like the brackets used to
represents the commands.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#any-other-symbol" id="any-other-symbol">Any other symbol</a></h3>
<p>Any other symbol besides the ones described above will be ignored by Ferris.
That does not mean that they aren't important. For they can help in constructing
more complex drawings.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>This section will provide an overview of the scaffolding of the project. We have
provided an command line interface you already used. That makes use of an api.
Read all about how these interact. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#command-line-interface" id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</a></h1>
<p>The entrypoint to our program is a good place to start, so that we can get a
sense for how all the pieces will fit together. The interface we're looking for
is something like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">l-system -f &lt;l-system-file&gt; -n &lt;iterations&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We need a few main pieces in order to render an l-system. First is a file
containing the description of our l-system. This will have the rules for symbol
replacements, defines the <em>axiom</em> and it will also contain some starting
configuration for our renderer. 
Lastly we have the number of iterations, which is the number of times that we
should apply the token substitution rules.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function should parse these arguments, parse the l-system described
in the file, then get the final productions and pass them to the renderer as
individual instructions. Once that is complete, it should call finalize on the
renderer. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#api-module" id="api-module"><code>api</code> Module</a></h1>
<p>In this section we describe the api that is provided that forms the tapestries
onto we weave our application.</p>
<p>It is good to keep in mind that we are working toward a Crab renderer. I.e. a
turtle graphics capable ferris that responds to our commands.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#renderconfig" id="renderconfig">RenderConfig</a></h2>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct RenderConfig {
    pub step: u16,
    pub angle: u16,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>RenderConfig</code> is used to configure the Crab renderer. <code>step</code> refers to the
distance the Crab will travel when stepping forward. <code>angle</code> refers to the
number of degrees the Crab will turn when we ask her to. This is what you'll parse from the l-system file.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#renderinstruction" id="renderinstruction">RenderInstruction</a></h2>
<p>We define this enum just to give us a simple way to represent what we want our Renderer to do. Our basic definition looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum RendererInstruction {
    Forward,
    RotateLeft,
    RotateRight,
    Push,
    Pop,
    NoOp,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is a fairly minimal instruction set, but you can still do a lot with it. More full-featured L-system implementations may have <a href="./extensions.html">more instructions</a>, but we'll start simple for now.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#symbol" id="symbol">Symbol</a></h2>
<p>The heart of any L-system is Symbols. It is, afterall, a symbol substitution language. <code>Symbol</code> is defined as a trait with a few simple properties. First, it must implement <code>Eq</code> and <code>Hash</code> since we will need to compare them and potentially store them in a hashmap. Secondly, it must implement <code>Copy</code> to facilitate easily producing <code>Symbol</code>s based on the rules in our L-system. Lastly, we want it to also implement <code>Display</code> so that we can produce a nicer output when debugging. For this workshop we'll use <code>char</code>, since it already implements all of those traits.</p>
<p>A <code>Symbol</code> must also implement the function <code>fn to_rendering_instruction(&amp;self) -&gt; RendererInstruction;</code>. This function maps each <code>Symbol</code> to an instruction for our renderer to execute. One important bit to point out is that our <code>RendererInstruction</code> enum includes a <code>NoOp</code> instruction, which instructs our Renderer to do nothing. We define this instruction so that it's clear when a <code>Symbol</code> does not map to any particular <code>RendererInstruction</code>. There are way more valid <code>char</code> values than there are <code>RendererInstruction</code> variants, so we need a clear way to represent the case when a <code>Symbol</code> is only used for matching substitutions.</p>
<p>For our workshop, the mapping between <code>char</code> values and rendering instructions will be hard coded as part of the <code>Symbol::to_rendering_instruction</code> function. This mapping follows a fairly common convention, but other implementations will handle this differently. Some implementations even allow you do define this mapping yourself, but we'll leave all that for <a href="./extenstions.html">extra credit</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rule" id="rule">Rule</a></h2>
<p>The L-system file will contain a <code>rules:</code> section that has one or more rules for symbol replacement. In our API we'll represent each rule as a struct containing the <code>Symbol</code> to match and a <code>Vec&lt;Symbol&gt;</code> of replacements to produce. For example, the rule <code>F =&gt; F+F--F+F</code> would be represented by:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
Rule {
    match_input: 'F',
    productions: vec!['F', '+', 'F', '-', '-', 'F', '+', 'F'],
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lsystemrules" id="lsystemrules">LSystemRules</a></h2>
<p>Once we have all the <code>Rule</code>s parsed, we'll represent the complete set of rules as a <code>HashMap&lt;char, Vec&lt;char&gt;&gt;</code> where the keys are the <code>Symbol</code>s to match and the values are the productions for that symbol. This just facilitates easy lookups.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lsystem" id="lsystem">LSystem</a></h2>
<p>This struct is just a holder for the complete set of data that's been parsed from an l-system file. This represents almost everything we need in order to render the final image. The only additional piece we'll need is the number of iterations, but we pass that as a command line argument.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#parser-1" id="parser-1">Parser</a></h1>
<p>In the L-system section you have had the opportunity to learn about and play with
Lindenmayer systems. The Parser section starts our journey of creating our own
software to explore L-systems.</p>
<p>The journey starts with teaching the computer about <code>.ls</code> files and what we
describe with them. </p>
<p>Make sure to look in to <a href="dependencies.html">working with dependencies</a> to find out
how to incorporate your code into the project.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-parser" id="what-is-a-parser">What is a Parser?</a></h1>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parser</a> is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data
structure ‚Äì often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other
hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while
checking for correct syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case we want to teach the computer to understand <code>.ls</code> files. This is our
<em>input data</em>. Although this input is convenient for us, it is just a sequences of
bytes to a computer.</p>
<p>What we want is an L-system that we can manipulate. That is our <em>data
structure</em>. Parsing is what brings us from our input data to our L-system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#parser-framework" id="parser-framework">Parser framework</a></h2>
<p>We will be building our own Parser framework. I.e. we will build the
infrastructure that allows us to create a custom parser. We will use our
framework to create a specific parser that reads in our <code>.ls</code> files and create
the L-system for us.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#parser-combinator" id="parser-combinator">Parser Combinator</a></h2>
<p>Our framework will be based on the concept of Parser Combinators. A Parser
Combinator is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>higher-order function that accepts several parsers as input and returns a new
parser as its output. In this context, a parser is a function accepting strings
as input and returning some structure as output, typically a parse tree or a set
of indices representing locations in the string where parsing stopped
successfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this does not really makes sense to you. Keep reading and soon you will be an
expert Parser Combinatorist.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#looking-at-the-type" id="looking-at-the-type">Looking at the type</a></h1>
<p>Before we start out it is good to think what we want to achieve. This allows us
to reason about the constraints and capture those in our types.</p>
<p>A parser reads input and transforms that into some data structure. This already
provides us with a decision. I.e. what type is our input?</p>
<p>We want to make things easy for our selves and since string literals have type
<code>&amp;str</code> we our going to pick that as our input type.</p>
<p>We don't really know what output type is going to be, put we do know that the
parser could fail. Take a look at the following code</p>
<pre><code class="language-lsystem">F -&gt; FF
</code></pre>
<p>Although it looks like an L-system, it not quite an L-system. At least not in
the form we expect in the L-system section. The arrow is wrong!</p>
<p>Because the data-structure could be anything, we better make it a generic
parameter. So our first guess for the output type could be
<code>Result&lt;T, ParserError&gt;</code>, where <code>ParserError</code> is defined as</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ParseError {
    GenericError,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#combinator" id="combinator">Combinator</a></h2>
<p>Although our first guess isn't that far off, it is lacking some flexibility.
What we like to achieve is to easily combine different kind of parsers into a
more complex one.</p>
<p>With this goal in mind, we would like to pass information about what part of the
input still needs parsing. Because we want to feed that into a different parser,
that type should be <code>&amp;str</code>, our input type.</p>
<p>So our second guess is <code>Result&lt;(T, &amp;str), ParseError&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>A Parser returns either a tuple of the parsed result and the rest of the
input, or it returns an error. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#trait" id="trait">Trait</a></h2>
<p>We now can create a <code>trait</code> that describes the contract our parsers have. It is
little more than our consideration, with the correct use of lifetimes to keep
the compiler happy.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Parser&lt;'a, T&gt; {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(T, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt;;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>So a Parser is anything that has a <code>parse</code> method of the right signature.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-6" id="exercises-6">Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement the <code>Parser</code> trait and the <code>ParseError</code> enum in <code>src/framework.rs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#functions-are-parsers" id="functions-are-parsers">Functions are Parsers!</a></h1>
<p>With our <code>Parser</code> trait in place we can start implementing it. Thinking about
the trait one implementation springs to mind.</p>
<p>If we have a function, or a lambda expression for that matter, that has the
right signature. I.e. accepts a <code>&amp;str</code> and returns a 
<code>Result&lt;(T, &amp;str), ParseError&gt;</code>, in some sense it is a parser. We just have to
apply the function! </p>
<p>Let's start with that implementation.</p>
<pre><code>impl &lt;'a, T, F&gt; Parser&lt;'a, T&gt; for F where F: Fn(&amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(T, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(T, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
        self(input)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-7" id="exercises-7">Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Write the implementation of the <code>Parser</code> trait for <code>Fn(&amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(T, &amp;'a str), ParserError&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#parsing-a-char" id="parsing-a-char">Parsing a <code>char</code></a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we will spend some time explaining how to create a <code>Parser</code>
capable of parsing a <code>char</code>. We will go through all the motions and explain
all the steps.</p>
<p>Our goal for this chapter is to make the following test pass.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_a_character() {
        let input = &quot;ABCD&quot;;
        let parser = character('A');

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok(('A', &quot;BCD&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>So let's get started.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#character" id="character">Character</a></h2>
<p>Thinking about the challenge of parsing a <code>char</code> one could notice the following
things. Giving a certain <code>&amp;str</code>, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if it starts with the correct character.</li>
<li>If it does, return it and the rest of the <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>
<li>If it does not, report an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to be able to implement the <code>Parser</code> trait, there first needs to be
something we can implement the <code>Parser</code> trait for. This thing will need to keep
track of what character to parse.</p>
<p>We will use a struct <code>Character</code> for that. We will give it a field that tracks
the intended character to match.</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Character {
  character_to_match: char,
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser" id="impl-parser">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>Let's implement <code>Parser</code> for the <code>Character</code> struct. We will be guided by the outline above</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;'a&gt; Parser&lt;'a, char&gt; for Character {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(char, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
        if input.starts_with(self.character_to_match) {
            Ok((self.character_to_match, &amp;input[1..]))
        } else {
            Err(ParseError::ExpectingCharacter(self.character_to_match))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first two lines are the signature needed to adhere to the traits contract.
Next we check if the input starts with the character to match. If it does, we
return a succesful parse with the matched character and the remaining input.
Otherwise we announce an error, which we also need to add to our <code>ParseError</code>
enum.</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ParseError {
    GenericError,
    ExpectingCharacter(char),
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constructor" id="constructor">Constructor</a></h2>
<p>It is convenient to create a <em>constructor</em> for our <code>Character</code> struct. This eases the
burden of creating a <code>Character</code> parser.</p>
<pre><code>impl Character {
    pub fn new&lt;'a&gt;(character_to_match: char) -&gt; impl Parser&lt;'a, char&gt; {
        Self { character_to_match }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the return type of our constructor. It hides the implementation details.
It only tells you that you can expect to get something that implements a <code>Parser</code>
that returns a <code>char</code> on success.</p>
<p>This allows us greater flexibility in the future. We can easily change the structure
of Character without changing the constructor, or code that relies on it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#factory" id="factory">Factory</a></h2>
<p>An other convience is the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">factory</a>. A factory is a pattern that hides the
details of how an struct is created. It serves yet an other purpose, to use a name that
reflects the intention, instead of exposing the mechanism of construction.</p>
<p>So instead of writing <code>Character::new('a')</code>, we want to write <code>character('a')</code>. Under
the covers this is done by using the constructor for <code>Character</code>.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn character&lt;'a&gt;(character_to_match: char) -&gt; impl Parser&lt;'a, char&gt; {
    Character::new(character_to_match)
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Since the <code>Character</code> parser is an example of how parser can be created we are going to
summarize the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a datatype that allows the parser to do it's job.</li>
<li>Implement <code>Parser</code> for it.</li>
<li>Create a <em>constructor</em>.</li>
<li>Create a factory.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Character</code> parse was build of a struct. Implementing <code>Parser</code> was done by translating
the parsing process into rust. And constructor and factory were created for ease of use.</p>

</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#parsing-any-char" id="parsing-any-char">Parsing any <code>char</code></a></h1>
<p>In a previous chapter we created a parser that could parse a single
specific character. An other useful parser would parse a string
would start with any of a group of characters.</p>
<p>To be more precise. Let's say that we would like to parse a <code>&amp;str</code> if
it starts with a digit. What we would like to achieve is to pass the 
following test</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_any_digit() {
        let input = &quot;0123&quot;;
        let parser = any(|c: char| c.is_ascii_digit());

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok(('0', &quot;123&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>We will go through all the motions of creating a parser once more.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#any" id="any">Any</a></h2>
<p>We will create a struct that will contain everything it needs to
make our wish come through. For this we need to be able to store
a <em>predicate</em>, a function that will decide on the characters we
expect.</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Any&lt;F&gt; where F: Fn(char) -&gt; bool + Sized {
    predicate: F,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>F</code> is an alias for the <code>Fn(char) -&gt; bool + Sized</code> type.
Our predicate, is a function that accepts a character and tells
use if it does or does not fall in our category. The <code>Sized</code> restriction
is necessary because we want to store it in our field.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser-1" id="impl-parser-1">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>Next we our going to implement the <code>Parser</code> trait. The basic idea is,
given our input</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if it starts with a character from our category.</li>
<li>If it does, return it and the rest of the input.</li>
<li>If it does not, return an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference with the <code>Character</code> parser is that <code>String</code> does not have
a convenience method like <code>starts_with</code> that we can use. Instead we can use
an <em>iterator</em> over the characters of our input. See below for details.</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;'a, F&gt; Parser&lt;'a, char&gt; for Any&lt;F&gt; where F: Fn(char) -&gt; bool + Sized {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(char, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
        let character = input.chars().next();
        match character {
            Some(c) =&gt; {
                if (self.predicate)(c) {
                    Ok((c, &amp;input[1..]))
                } else {
                    Err(ParseError::ExpectingPredicate)
                }
            },

            None =&gt; {
                Err(ParseError::EndOfInput)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We ask our input for an iterator over its characters. Match on the first character
if it exists, and if it does, check to see if it is in the category. Notice that 
we introduced two new <code>ParseError</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ParseError {
    GenericError,
    ExpectingCharacter(char),
    ExpectingPredicate,
    EndOfInput,
}
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#constructor-and-factory" id="constructor-and-factory">Constructor and Factory</a></h1>
<p>The final two steps are to create a constructor and a convenient factory.</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F&gt; Any&lt;F&gt; where F: Fn(char) -&gt; bool + Sized {
    pub fn new(predicate: F) -&gt; Self {
        Self { predicate }
    }
}

pub fn any&lt;'a, F&gt;(predicate: F) -&gt; impl Parser&lt;'a, char&gt; where F: Fn(char) -&gt; bool + Sized {
    Any::new(predicate)
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>

<li>Implement <code>Parser</code> for it.</li>
<li>Create a <em>constructor</em>.</li>

<p>This pattern will be repeated many times.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#parsing-a-literal-string" id="parsing-a-literal-string">Parsing a Literal String</a></h1>
<p>Often you know exactly what you are looking for. E.g. when separating the the
symbol for its production we use <code>=&gt;</code>. I would come in handy if there was a
parser that could do that job.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_literal_arrow() {
        let input = &quot;=&gt; FF&quot;;
        let parser = literal(&quot;=&gt;&quot;);

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok((&quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot; FF&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#literal" id="literal">Literal</a></h2>
<p>The only thing that we need to keep track of is the string that we are
interested in. Rust provides various ways to model your data. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">Tuple
structs</a>
are a convenient way for our use case. It allows one to name a structure by
describing the fields in a tuple.</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Literal&lt;'p&gt;(&amp;'p str);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have a tuple with only one field. It does not have a name so we
need to reference it by index.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser-2" id="impl-parser-2">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>Parsing with a <code>Literal</code> amounts to the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the input starts with our literal.</li>
<li>If it does, chop of the parsed string and return it together with the
remaining input</li>
<li>If it does not, report an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>This translate into code as follows.</p>
<pre><code>impl &lt;'a, 'p&gt; Parser&lt;'a, &amp;'a str&gt; for Literal&lt;'p&gt; {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(&amp;'a str, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
        if input.starts_with(self.0) {
            let len = self.0.len();
            let substr = &amp;input[..len];
            let rem = &amp;input[len..];
            Ok((substr, rem))
        } else {
            Err(ParseError::ExpectingLiteral(self.0.to_owned()))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at the expected result. It has type <code>&amp;'a str</code>. We will return a
slice of the input, so the lifetime should match up.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constructor-1" id="constructor-1">Constructor</a></h2>
<p>Since tuple structs come with a build int constructor, we do not need to do
anything here.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#factory-1" id="factory-1">Factory</a></h2>
<p>The factory for the <code>Literal</code> parser can just be a function <code>literal</code> to returns
the parser</p>
<pre><code>pub fn literal(match_exactly: &amp;str) -&gt; Literal {
    Literal(match_exactly)
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-10" id="exercises-10">Exercises</a></h2>

<h1><a class="header" href="#combinators" id="combinators">Combinators</a></h1>
<p>We havee implemented a few parser. Each followed the same pattern.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a datatype that allows the parser to do it's job.</li>
<li>Implement <code>Parser</code> for it.</li>
<li>Create a <em>constructor</em>.</li>
<li>Create a factory.</li>
</ol>
<p>This pattern suffices, but it get's tedious. Instead we would rather
use the power of <em>abstraction</em>. Rather than to depend on the manual
work to create a parser for each situation, we want to have some 
primitive parser that we can combine into a more elaborate parser.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces you to the concept and some considerations
we will meet along the way.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-combinator" id="what-is-a-combinator">What is a combinator</a></h2>
<p>In our case a combinator is a <em>higher order</em> parser. It takes one or
more parsers and <em>combines</em> them into a new parser.</p>
<p>Let's stare into the future together, in order to better understand
combinators.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have a parser that could parse a single rule of a 
L-system. How we acquired this parser is of no concern. Just that
we can use it.</p>
<p>Now as you know, L-systems often have many rules. So we would like
a parser that could parse many rules. We could use the rule parser
and manually try to parse a rule, and when it succeed try for the
next rule.</p>
<p>This would certainly work! But it would not help in the situation
where we have a parser to parse a single whitespace and would want
a parser to parse a many whitespaces. This is a very similar 
situation to the rule parser, the only difference being the kind
of parser you want many of.</p>
<p>Instead we are going to write a <em>combinator</em>. This is a parser that
accepts as an argument one or more parsers, in our example the rule
parser or the whitespace parser, and returns a parser that combines
them in an interesting way. In our example that would be the many
combinator.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#combinator-pattern" id="combinator-pattern">Combinator Pattern</a></h2>
<p>What we have described for parser is an example of a more general
pattern. I.e. the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Combinator_pattern">combinator pattern</a>. It says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>complex structures are built by defining a small set of very simple 
'primitives', and a set of 'combinators' for combining them into 
more complicated structures. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you squint hard you can find our explanation of the phenomenon
for parser in the description.</p>
<p>So the next few chapters will concentrate on the description of
various combinators.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#map" id="map">Map</a></h1>
<p>The first combinator we are going describe is the <code>Map</code> combinator.
Let's say we have a parser to parse a digit, i.e.
<code>any(|c: char| c.is_ascii_digit())</code>. But we are not interested in the
character, but in the integer.</p>
<p><code>char</code> has a method that can return the numeric value of a digit
character. It has the following signature. </p>
<pre><code>pub fn to_digit(self, radix: u32) -&gt; Option&lt;u32&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the return type is an <code>Option</code>, because if all you have is
a character, you are not sure how to turn it into a number. E.g. What
is the value of <code>Y</code>?</p>
<p>So the code we would like to run is something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_any_digit_as_number() {
        let input = &quot;1230&quot;;
        let parser = map(
          any(|c: char| c.is_ascii_digit()), 
          |c: char| c.to_digit(10).unwrap_or(0));

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok((1, &quot;230&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>During the mapping we are unwrapping the option with a default value of
zero.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#map-1" id="map-1">Map</a></h2>
<p>With our goal clear, we still are following our strategy. So, let's first
create a struct.</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Map&lt;'a, I, O, P, F&gt; where I: 'a, P: Parser&lt;'a, I&gt; + Sized, F: Fn(I) -&gt; O + Sized {
    parser: P,
    map: F,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Woah, that signature has a lot of stuff in it. Let's break it done step by step.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#lifetimes--generics" id="lifetimes--generics">Lifetimes &amp; Generics</a></h3>
<p>First of all there is a lifetime ``a<code>parameter. This lifetime is needed by</code>Parser` and keeps track of the lifetime of the input.</p>
<p>Next are generic parameters <code>I</code> and <code>O</code>. They are used by the other generic
parameters <code>P</code> and <code>F</code>.  Almost all of these are aliases.</p>
<p><code>I</code> is restricted to <code>I: 'a</code>. It should live as long as our input. Together
with the chosen letter <code>I</code>, it probably stands for some form of input.</p>
<p><code>P</code> is restricted to <code>P: Parser&lt;'a, I&gt; + Sized</code>. So <code>P</code> is a parser that
produces an <code>I</code>. For example our <code>any</code> parser is a produces an <code>char</code>.</p>
<p><code>F</code> is restricted to <code>F: Fn(I) -&gt; O + Sized</code>. Now it becomes clear would
<code>I</code> and <code>O</code> are. They are the input and output for the function <code>F</code>. So
<code>F</code> is a function that is used to map the result of parser <code>P</code>, which is
of type <code>I</code>, into type <code>O</code>.</p>
<p>Pfew, that was a lot to take in. But with an overview all the parts make
sense.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#phantomdata" id="phantomdata"><code>PhantomData</code></a></h3>
<p>Unfortunatly, this will not compile. The compiler warns us of several
unused parameters. E.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">82 | pub struct Map&lt;'a, I, O, P, F&gt; where I: 'a, P: Parser&lt;'a, I&gt; + Sized, F: Fn(I) -&gt; O + Sized {
   |                ^^ unused parameter
   |
   = help: consider removing `'a` or using a marker such as `std::marker::PhantomData`
</code></pre>
<p>The advice of removing the lifetime parameter is not an option for us.
We need it for our parser <code>P</code>. Maybe the other advice is viable.</p>
<p>The doccumentation of <code>PhantomData</code> reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zero-sized type used to mark things that &quot;act like&quot; they own a T.</p>
<p>Adding a PhantomData<T> field to your type tells the compiler that 
your type acts as though it stores a value of type T, even though
it doesn't really. This information is used when computing certain 
safety properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is precisely our case. What a good compiler our compiler is. So
we will follow our compilers advice and add a phantom field to our
struct.</p>
<pre><code>    phantom: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a I&gt;,
</code></pre>
<p>Which satisfies the compiler.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser-3" id="impl-parser-3">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>With our struct out of the way, we should focus on the implementation.
What we want to achieve is</p>
<ol>
<li>Try the parser.</li>
<li>Map the result with our function, keeping the rest of our input.</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the verbose type signatures this translates very well into Rust.</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;'a, I, O, P, F&gt; Parser&lt;'a, O&gt; for Map&lt;'a, I, O, P, F&gt; where I: 'a, P: Parser&lt;'a, I&gt; + Sized, F: Fn(I) -&gt; O + Sized {
    fn parse(&amp;self, input: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Result&lt;(O, &amp;'a str), ParseError&gt; {
        let attempt = self.parser.parse(input);
        attempt.map(|(v, rest)|{ ((self.map)(v), rest)})
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constructor--factory" id="constructor--factory">Constructor &amp; Factory</a></h2>
<p>Creating the constructor and factory is almost straight forward, albeit
verbose. Accept the parameters you need and create the <code>Map</code>. The only
snag is that <code>PhantomData</code>.</p>
<p>Luckily the way to assign a <code>PhantomData</code> is by doing just that.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We have just created our first combinator! It takes a parser and transforms
its result into something different.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-11" id="exercises-11">Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement the <code>Map</code> parser.</li>
<li>Write some tests to check your implementation.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#between" id="between">Between</a></h1>
<p>We are capable of parsing, but all the parsers we have seen
only parse a single character. Let's say we want to parse a
number instead of a single digit.</p>
<p>For that we our going to look at the <code>Between</code> parser. We
expect it to work like the following.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_between_2_and_4_digits() {
        let input = &quot;12345&quot;;
        let parser = between(2, 4, any(|c: char| c.is_ascii_digit()));

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok((vec!['1', '2', '3', '4'], &quot;5&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#considerations" id="considerations">Considerations</a></h2>
<p>By now the strategy to creating a parser is not new. Now we have
to think about what we need to represent this parser. We need
some sort of lower bound, an upper bound and a parser that we
want to parse between the lower and upper bound times.</p>
<p>The lower bound can be just a number. Because you can not parse
less than zero times, negative numbers are not necessary. The type
for the lower bound can be any unsigned number. We will settle for
<code>u8</code>.</p>
<p>The upper bound is a little trickier. There is no natural limit,
we could be interested in all characters that match a certain parser.</p>
<p>To accomadate this we are going to introduce a custom enum <code>Limit</code>.</p>
<pre><code>pub enum Limit {
  At(u8),
  Infinity,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This way we can specify either an unlimited bound, or a bound at a
specific value.</p>
<p>Because we likely will want to check if the upper bound is reached,
we introduce a method that allows use to check that.</p>
<pre><code>impl Limit {
  pub fn is_bigger_then(&amp;self, n: u8) -&gt; bool {
    match self {
      Limit::At(threshold) =&gt; threshold &gt; &amp;n,

      Limit::Infinity =&gt; true,
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That are almost all the considerations for the <code>Between</code> struct we
need. Let's see if you can come up with an implementation. Do note
that you probably need to think about <code>PhantomData</code> at some point.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser-4" id="impl-parser-4">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>So we have a struct that tracks the lower limit, the upper limit and
the base parser. The implementation strategy is.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to parse as many as the lower limit of items, accumulating the
result.</li>
<li>If that fails, report the error.</li>
<li>If it succeeds, go on to the optional phase.</li>
<li>Try to parse up to the upper limit of items.</li>
<li>If that fails, cut your losses and return the accumulated result.</li>
<li>If that succeeds, return the accumulated result. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constructor--factory-1" id="constructor--factory-1">Constructor &amp; Factory</a></h2>
<p>Create an appropriate constructor and factories. See the exercises
for some factory suggestions.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-3" id="summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This combinator is very versatile. It can accomodate a lot of different
scenarios, depending on how you construct it. Writing factories that
reflect your needs is always a good strategy.</p>
<p>On should write code that one wants and write implementations to make
that happen.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#oneof" id="oneof">OneOf</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes you want to have a choice. E.g. an expression could either be a number
or a variable. So when parsing an expression you want the option to parse one of
a number or variable.</p>
<p>This is where the <code>OneOf</code> parser comes in. It will pass the following test.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_one_of_a_or_b() {
        let input = &quot;a1&quot;;
        let parser = one_of(vec![character('a'), character('b')]);

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok(('a', &quot;1&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#considerations-1" id="considerations-1">Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Since the <code>Parser</code> trait can return only a single thing, all of our options in
the <code>OneOf</code> parser should adhere to the same contract.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-parser-5" id="impl-parser-5">Impl Parser</a></h2>
<p>Once you have your options our parse strategy would be to try each of our
options in turn until one of them succeed. If it succeed return the parsed
result and the remaining input. If none of the options succeed, report an error.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#utilities" id="utilities">Utilities</a></h1>
<p>This chapter introduces some convenient parsers that we will use when we will be
parsing more complex structures.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#skip" id="skip">skip</a></h2>
<p>You are not always interested in what you are parsing. Whitespace is a good
example. The <code>skip</code> factory creates a parser that allows you to transform a
parser into one that ignores the result.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_skip_many_spaces() {
        let input = &quot;           next&quot;;
        let parser = skip(many(character(' ')));

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok(((), &quot;next&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>An implementation can be given in terms of the primitives and the combinators
already given.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#space--spaces" id="space--spaces">space &amp; spaces</a></h2>
<p>A useful building block, to ignore, are white space. The following would be a
nice addition to our utility belt. </p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_spaces() {
        let input = &quot;           \tnext&quot;;
        let parser = spaces();

        let actual = parser.parse(input);

        let expected = Ok(((), &quot;next&quot;));
        assert_eq!(actual, expected);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget about the fact that a <em>tab</em> character also counts as white space.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#newline" id="newline">newline</a></h2>
<p>It is nice to be able to know when a line ends. Line ends are signified by
newline. Depending on the that could be one of <code>\n</code>, <code>\r</code> or <code>\r\n</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#digit" id="digit">digit</a></h2>
<p>This parser is an intermediate parser for numbers. It would be nice to be able

<h2><a class="header" href="#number" id="number">number</a></h2>
<p>Many digits strung together form a number.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#end" id="end">end</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we just want to make sure that we completely parsed a structure. I.e.
nothing of the input should be left over after we are finished parsing.</p>
<p>An <code>end</code> parser should come in handy with that. It accepts a parser and
depending on that parser succeeds it will either</p>
<ul>
<li><em>when successful with an empty remainder</em> return the result and an empty
remainder.</li>
<li><em>when successful with remaining input</em> report an error.</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#macros" id="macros">Macros</a></h1>
<p>We have a fair amount of basic parsers and lovely combinators for them. But
there is one thing missing. All the parsers we have so far can only parse one
thing.</p>
<p>Give a parser an input, it will try do its job, return the result and the rest
of the input. But if we want to parse complex structures, we need to be able to
proceed parsing an that rest of the input. We need to be able to chain different
parser together, one after the other.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-we-want-to-achieve" id="what-we-want-to-achieve">What we want to achieve</a></h2>
<p>Let's say we want to parse something that looks like a L-system rule. Remember,
it starts with a symbol, followed by a literal <code>=&gt;</code> and at last a sequence of
symbols.</p>
<p>What needs to be done is that we feed the remainder of one parser into the next.
Something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>let rem = input;
let (symbol, rem) = symbol_parser.parse(rem)?
let (_, rem) = literal('=&gt;').parse(rem)?
let (production, rem) = at_least(1, symbol_parser).parse(rem)?
</code></pre>
<p>Once we have the symbol and its production we can combine them to form a rule.</p>
<p>Although this is not hard, there is a lot of plumbing that is neither
interesting or exciting. We would rather focus on chaining the parsers and
combing their results.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#declarative-macros" id="declarative-macros">Declarative Macros</a></h2>
<p>Rust has a great mechanism to aid in our search for expressiveness. It are
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">declarative macros</a>.</p>
<p>Declarative macros</p>
<blockquote>
<p>allow you to write something similar to a Rust match expression. As discussed
in Chapter 6, match expressions are control structures that take an
expression, compare the resulting value of the expression to patterns, and
then run the code associated with the matching pattern. Macros also compare a
value to patterns that are associated with particular code: in this situation,
the value is the literal Rust source code passed to the macro; the patterns
are compared with the structure of that source code; and the code associated
with each pattern, when matched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This
all happens during compilation </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are ideal for our situation.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#parsing-a-sequence" id="parsing-a-sequence">Parsing a sequence</a></h1>
<p>We would like to parse a sequence of things. First this, followed by that and
finally this thing again. At the moment we have no way of describing that. Let's
remedy that.</p>
<p>What we want to achieve is to make the following test pass.</p>
<pre><code>    #[test]
    fn parse_a_sequence_of_parsers() {
        let parser = sequence!{
            let a = character('A'),
            let b = character('b')
            =&gt;
            (a, b)
        };

        let (result, rem) = parser.parse(&quot;Ab&quot;).expect(&quot;failed to parse&quot;);
        
        assert_eq!(('A', 'b'), result);
        assert!(rem.is_empty());
    }
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-do-we-want" id="what-do-we-want">What do we want</a></h2>
<p>As stated in the Macros chapter, we want to sequence parsers without having to
write all the boilerplate. As detailed in the test code above, we want to focus
on the result of parsers and combine those results in interesting ways.</p>
<p>The pattern that we picked is, one or more lines of</p>
<pre><code>let identifier = parser,
</code></pre>
<p>We would like to translate the above lines into something like</p>
<pre><code>let (identifier, remainder) = parser.parse(remainder)?
</code></pre>
<p>I.e. pass the remaining input to the parser to parse, collect the result and
bind it to the identifier and rebind the remainder.</p>
<p>Once all the parser sequences have done their job, we would like to collect all
the parse results in some meaningful manner. E.g. if we have parsed an <code>'A'</code>
followed by a <code>'b'</code>, we would return a tuple containing both results. More
general we want to return some form of expression involving the parse results.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#macros-to-the-rescue" id="macros-to-the-rescue">Macros to the rescue</a></h2>
<p>Luckily macros are well suited for the task. Look at the following code. We will
explain it in detail.</p>
<pre><code>#[macro_export]
macro_rules! sequence {
    ( $(let $name:ident = $parser:expr),+ =&gt; $finish:expr ) =&gt; {{
        |input| {
            let rem = input;
            $(
                let ($name, rem) = $parser.parse(rem)?;
            )*
            let result = $finish;
            Ok((result, rem))
        }
    }};
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#macro_export-attribute" id="macro_export-attribute"><code>macro_export</code> attribute</a></h3>
<p>Let's start at the top. The <code>macro_export</code> attribute tells us that we would like
to make this macro available whenever the crate is in scope.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#macro_rules-macro" id="macro_rules-macro"><code>macro_rules!</code> macro</a></h3>
<p>The way to define a macro is by using the <code>macro_rule</code> macro. It will accept a
name and shapes that the macro should accepts and how they are translated.</p>
<p>In our case are creating a macro called <code>sequence</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-pattern" id="the-pattern">The pattern</a></h3>
<p>The pattern our macro accepts is defined next. It is </p>
<pre><code>( $(let $name:ident = $parser:expr),+ =&gt; $finish:expr )
</code></pre>
<p>First let's focus on <code>let $name:ident = $parser:expr</code>. It expresses how we want
to string a results of parser. This pattern will try to match expressions like</p>
<pre><code>let a = character('A')
</code></pre>
<p>first the literal <code>let</code> next something that looks like an identifier, <code>a</code> in this
case. if it succeeds bind the identifier to the <code>$name</code> variable. Next comes a
literal <code>=</code> followed by something that looks like any Rust expression,
<code>characcter('A')</code> in our example, and bind that expression to the <code>$parser</code>
variable.</p>
<p>Notice that that entire pattern is surrounded by <code>$( ),+</code>. The plus tells us
that we need at least one, but are allowed more repetition of what ever pattern
is between the brackets, separated by an (final optional) comma.</p>
<p>Next there is a literal <code>=&gt;</code> followed by something that looks like any rust
expression. If that matches bind the expression to the <code>$finish</code> expression.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-substitutions" id="the-substitutions">The substitutions</a></h3>
<p>Declarative macros in Rust work by taking the pattern and providing a
substitution, that needs to adhere to some rules. </p>
<pre><code>    {{
        |input| {
            let rem = input;
            $(
                let ($name, rem) = $parser.parse(rem)?;
            )*
            let result = $finish;
            Ok((result, rem))
        }
    }};
</code></pre>
<p>Now this substitution will be replaced with the data that is gathered when
matching the syntax. We notice that it will return a lambda expression that
accepts input, and returns a pair of result and the remaining input. I.e. it is
a parser.</p>
<p>What is returned is in effect handled by </p>
<pre><code>            $(
                let ($name, rem) = $parser.parse(rem)?;
            )*
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>$( )*</code> will output its contents for each of the matching parts.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#use-the-framework" id="use-the-framework">Use the framework</a></h1>
<p>We have created a parser combinator framework that allows us to create a parser
that parses the L-systems by combining primitive parser into more elaborate
parsers.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will work towards that goal. It will be one of the most
challenging chapters in this book. You are asked to use your creative mind to
fill in the gaps.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#high-level-description" id="high-level-description">High level description</a></h2>
<p>We will give a top down description of the structure of the L-system format.
This identifies goals to reach and helps with achieving</p>
<p>When seeing the L-system format from a mile away, it seems to consist of two
parts. First is the configuration section, which defines common settings for the
interpretation of the L-system.
Next is some number of blank lines followed by the actual rules of the system.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#config-2" id="config-2">Config</a></h3>
<p>The <em>configuration</em> section is started with a <em>header</em>, i.e. a literal <code>config</code> followed
by a colon and a newline.</p>
<p>Next are two key value pairs. A key value pair is a an literal key followed by
an equal sign and a certain value. The first key value pair is the <em>step</em>, which
assigns the <em>number</em> of times the system needs to be iterated.
After that the <em>angle</em> which determines the <em>number</em> of degrees a turtle should
rotate.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#rules-2" id="rules-2">Rules</a></h3>
<p>Just like the configuration section is the <em>rules</em> section started with it's own
header. This time the header identifier is <code>rules</code>.</p>
<p>Next comes a the seed for the system, i.e the <em>axiom</em> which is a key value pair
which should be at least 1 <em>symbol</em>.</p>
<p>Following that are many <em>rules</em>. Each <em>rule</em> is described by a <em>symbol</em> that
will be mapped onto its <em>production</em>, i.e. a sequence of at least 1 symbol.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-16" id="exercises-16">Exercises</a></h2>
<p>Use the parser combinator framework to create a parser that can parser system
files. Make sure to test your parser building blocks.</p>
<p>Don't forget to alter the <code>parse</code> function to use the parser you created.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#interpreter-1" id="interpreter-1">Interpreter</a></h1>
<p>In the Parser section we created a parser for <code>.ls</code> files that could return a
L-system data structure. We would now like to interpret this data structure in
order to evolve the L-system a number of iterations.</p>
<p>The Interpreter section will guide use along that path and describes how to
create software that can interpret our L-system and evolve the start word.</p>
<p>Make sure to look in to <a href="dependencies.html">working with dependencies</a> to find out
how to incorporate your code into the project.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-interpreter" id="what-is-an-interpreter">What is an Interpreter</a></h1>
<p>One could view an L-system as a kind of programming language. It describes in a
declarative way how to produce a series of symbols. What we will do in this
section is write an interpreter.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a
programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have
been compiled into a machine language program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case the instructions is the L-system, as parsed by our parser. Execution
is producing the series of symbols for a certain level.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#signature" id="signature">Signature</a></h1>
<p>Let's think about the signature of the interpreter. We do this by coming up with
a code example that we would like to write. This will guide our thoughts towards
an API that is easy to work with. Below you find our dream code.</p>
<pre><code>let interpreter = Interpreter::new(system);

let word = interpreter.level(4);

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, word)
</code></pre>
<p>We assume that we have a L-system bound to the variable <code>system</code>. It does not
really matter where we got the system from, just assume that we have it for now.</p>
<p>We would like to create a <code>Interpreter</code> for this system by calling the <code>new</code>
constructor.</p>
<p>Next we would like to ask the interpreter for the <code>word</code> that is produced by
iterating the L-system a number of times. This should produce a vector of
symbols.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#interpreter-struct" id="interpreter-struct">Interpreter Struct</a></h2>
<p>Our dream code tells us a lot about the structure of our interpreter. Let's
flesh out some of the details to make our dreams come true.</p>
<pre><code>use api::{LSystem, Symbol};

pub struct Interpreter&lt;T&gt; where T: Symbol {
    lsystem: LSystem&lt;T&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We create a struct that will be the target for all of our dreams. It keeps track
of a <code>LSystem</code>. If you need a refresher about the api module, go read that
section.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#impl-interpreter" id="impl-interpreter">Impl Interpreter</a></h2>
<p>We can make a start with implementing the interpreter.</p>
<pre><code>impl &lt;T&gt; Interpreter&lt;T&gt; where T: Symbol {
    pub fn new(lsystem: LSystem&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Self {
        Self { lsystem }
    }

    pub fn level(&amp;self, n : usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; {
        vec![] // TODO actual interpret the system
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>new</code> constructor accepts an <code>LSystem</code>, making sure to take ownership of it.
Other than the <code>level</code> function. There is not much going on. Note that we still
have something to do.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exercises-17" id="exercises-17">Exercises</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement the <code>Interpreter</code> struct.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#level" id="level"><code>level</code></a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we get down to the brass tacks and implement the <code>level</code>
function of the <code>Interpreter</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#process" id="process">Process</a></h2>
<p>As we learned in the L-system section, interpretation of the system comes down
to repeatedly iterating the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the current <em>word</em></li>
<li>Replace each <em>symbol</em> with it's production.</li>
</ol>
<p>A word for is a vector of symbols. A symbol is anything that implements the
<code>Symbol</code> trait.</p>
<p>Knowing the production for each symbol is the job of the L-system, specifically
the rules of the L-system.</p>
<p>To start this process of, we need a jumping of point. Our <code>axiom</code>. Is exactly
what we need.</p>
<p>So it seems that we have everything in place to get started.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#successors" id="successors"><code>successors</code></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html">Iterators</a> are ubiquitous in Rust. From the documentation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you've found yourself with a collection of some kind, and needed to perform
an operation on the elements of said collection, you'll quickly run into
'iterators'. Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic Rust code, so it's worth
becoming familiar with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we want to iterate our process, iterators should fit the bill. And Rust
doesn't disappoint.</p>
<p>In the standard library there is an iterator <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/fn.successors.html"><code>Successors</code></a> that is
perfect for our scenario. We only need to provide the first item and the
<code>succ</code> function that compute each item's successor</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first" id="first">first</a></h2>
<p>The first item of our successors iterator it the axiom of our L-system. Because
we need to transfer ownership to the caller, we better clone the axiom before
iterating on it.</p>
<pre><code>let start: Vec&lt;T&gt; = self.lsystem.axiom.iter().cloned().collect();
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#succ" id="succ"><code>succ</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>succ</code> function signature is <code>FnMut(&amp;Vec&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. It is
called with the our current word, and should return the successor.</p>
<pre><code>|word|{
    let next = word.iter().flat_map(|symbol| self.lsystem.rules.apply(*symbol)).collect();
    Some(next)
})
</code></pre>
<p>Let's unpack that, on step at the time.</p>
<p>To access the individual symbols in our word we iterate over them with
<code>word.iter()</code>. Next we want to map each symbol to its production, hence the
<code>|symbol| self.lsystem.rules.apply(*symbol)</code>. But since each production is a
vector of symbols in itself, we use a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.flat_map">flat map</a> instead of a regular
map. Since we want a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> at some point we <code>collect</code> the successor.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#putting-it-together" id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</a></h2>
<p>All the moving parts of the implementation are in place, we just have to put
together.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn level(&amp;self, n : usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    let start: Vec&lt;T&gt; = self.lsystem.axiom.iter().cloned().collect();
    successors(Some(start), |word|{
        let next = word.iter().flat_map(|symbol| self.lsystem.rules.apply(*symbol)).collect();
        Some(next)
    }).nth(n).unwrap() // there should always be an production
}
</code></pre>
<p>One final trick can be found at the end. It uses the <code>nth</code> function on
<code>Iterator</code>s to pick the word we want. Since we always produce an next word, the
unwrap can be safely done.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#renderer-1" id="renderer-1">Renderer</a></h1>
<p>With a working parser and interpreter for L-systems, it is time to work on
rendering. Rendering concerns itself providing a translation between the 
L-systems words that occur from the start word and some kind of visualization.</p>
<p>Make sure to look in to <a href="dependencies.html">working with dependencies</a> to find out
how to incorporate your code into the project.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#renderer-2" id="renderer-2">Renderer</a></h1>
<p>A Renderer takes the sequence of productions from the L-system and displays them in some way. We've included an example renderer that simply prints each symbol to stdout. This is really useful for debugging, but it's not very pretty to look at.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we're going to create a new Renderer implementation that uses turtle graphics to render the productions from our l-system as two dimensional line drawings. Turtle graphics is an approach that uses an API that's conceptually based on a <em>pen</em> that is controlled by giving it a sequence of instructions. For example, <code>go forward 2 steps, turn right, go forward 1 step, turn right, go forward 2 steps</code>. Of course a pen is an inanimate object and they're terrible at following instructions, so traditionally a turtle is in charge of the pen, though in our case it will be a crab instead. The crab will faithfully carry our each of the instructions in order to create our image.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#renderer-api" id="renderer-api">Renderer API</a></h2>
<p>To start with, our renderer trait looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Renderer {
    /// Called at the very beginning of the entrypoint to our program so that the renderer can create a window if needed
    fn global_init() where Self: Sized {}

    /// Render the given symbol. This will get called repeatedly in order to create our images
    fn render(&amp;mut self, symbol: impl Symbol);

    /// Signals that the final instruction has been given and we can clean up and do any finalization that's required
    fn finish(&amp;mut self) {}
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In the next sections, we'll go over each of the <code>Renderer</code> functions in more detail.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#renderer-initialization" id="renderer-initialization">Renderer Initialization</a></h1>
<p>Each operating system provides its own APIs for drawing images to the screen, and these APIs are sometimes fairly complex. Typically, there's a need to create a window, which you can then draw into. The APIs also provide ways to get input events from the user's mouse and keyboard. We want our L-systems renderer to run on a variety of platforms, and so we must program to the lowest common denominator of all the platforms we wish to support. The first function declared on the <code>Renderer</code> trait is <code>fn global_init()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>global_init</code> function is the very first thing that's called when our application starts up. We'll use this function to create a window that we can draw into. Windowing and event handling apis can be relatively complex, and every platform has its own quirks. It's common for the operating system to require that window creation is done very early in the application lifecycle, so we'll always call this function right away in our application's main function. It's important that we call this function <em>before</em> we do things like parsing arguments or writing to stdout and stderr.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation" id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Our implementation of <code>global_init</code> is pretty easy, since the turtle crate handles all the cross platform complexities for us. We just need to call the <a href="https://docs.rs/turtle/1.0.0-rc.2/turtle/fn.start.html"><code>turtle::start()</code></a> function.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#basic-renderer-configuration" id="basic-renderer-configuration">Basic Renderer Configuration</a></h1>
<p>Our renderer instructions are very simple and abstract. For example, to draw a straight line we would use the <code>Forward</code> instruction. The <code>Forward</code> instruction doesn't itself say <em>how far</em> to move. That is instead specified in a separate struct as the <code>step</code> field. Whenever we execute the <code>Forward</code> instruction, <code>step</code> tells us how far to move. Why would these be separate? The answer is that the language we use to describe the L-system has no way to maintain state. The Renderer implementation is responsible for maintaining the state of the current <code>step</code> and <code>angle</code>, but the initial values are specified in the <code>RendererConfig</code>.</p>
<p>The basic <code>RendererConfig</code> struct looks something like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct RendererConfig {
    pub step: u16,
    pub angle: u16,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We'll want a function that takes the configuration as a parameter and returns a new <code>Crab</code> struct that's ready to use.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#turtle-crab-rendering" id="turtle-crab-rendering">Turtle (Crab) Rendering</a></h1>
<p>Ok, so we have a <code>Crab</code> that's brandishing a pen, and we've got everything initialized and configured. So how do we actually work with this thing?
The <code>Turtle</code> API is pretty simple and straightforward. It's easy to implement each individual rendering instruction. The complexity of how multiple instructions are combined to draw interesting shapes will be left to the L-systems.</p>
<p>The <code>render</code> function is where the magic happens. This function will be invoked many times, once for each <code>Symbol</code> that's produced by the L-system, based on the axiom and number of iterations. The first thing we need to do is to convert the <code>Symbol</code> into a  <code>RendererInstruction</code>. Then we can use pattern matching to determine what to do. This would look something like the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn render(&amp;mut self, symbol: impl Symbol) {
    match symbol.to_rendering_instruction() {
        RendererInstruction::Forward =&gt; self.forward(),
        RendererInstruction::RotateLeft =&gt; self.rotate_left(),
        RendererInstruction::RotateRight =&gt; self.rotate_right(),
        RendererInstruction::NoOp =&gt; { /* no-op just means that the Symbol didn't map to any particular rendering instruction */ },
        /* .... remainder omitted for brevity */
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Since this pattern matching isn't particularly interesting, we'll update our <code>Renderer</code> trait to provide the implementation on the trait itself, which will just delegate to named functions for each instruction. We'll add a function to the <code>Renderer</code> trait for each instruction so that the code will be more readable. So instead of implementing <code>render</code> directly, we'll just implemet each of the specific functions like <code>forward</code>, <code>rotate_left</code>, <code>rotate_right</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc. So now our <code>Renderer</code> trait will look more like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Renderer {
    fn global_init() where Self: Sized {}

    fn render(&amp;mut self, instruction: RendererInstruction) {
        match instruction {
            RendererInstruction::Forward =&gt; self.forward(),
            RendererInstruction::RotateLeft =&gt; self.rotate_left(),
            RendererInstruction::RotateRight =&gt; self.rotate_right(),
            RendererInstruction::Push =&gt; self.push(),
            RendererInstruction::Pop =&gt; self.pop(),
            RendererInstruction::NoOp =&gt; { /* no-op */ },
        }
    }

    fn forward(&amp;mut self) {}
    fn push(&amp;mut self) {}
    /* .... remainder of functions omitted for brevity */

    fn finish(&amp;mut self) {}
}

impl Renderer for Crab {
    fn forward(&amp;mut self) { /* move forward */ }
    fn rotate_left(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ }
    fn forward(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ }
}

<p>The <code>Forward</code> instruction moves the crab forward by the <code>step</code>, drawing a straight line along the way. Implementing this is quite simple. Just call the <a href="https://docs.rs/turtle/1.0.0-rc.2/turtle/struct.Turtle.html#method.forward"><code>Turtle::forward</code></a> function, passing in the current value for <code>step</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#rotation" id="rotation">Rotation</a></h3>
<p><code>RotateLeft</code>, <code>RotateRight</code> rotate the crab in place. &quot;Right&quot; means clockwise, and &quot;left&quot; means counter-clockwise. Keep in mind that we're using degrees instead of radians (although, this is a fairly arbitrary decision and it's also reasonable for an l-system to use radians).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#renderer-state-management" id="renderer-state-management">Renderer State Management</a></h1>
<p>You'll notice that our <code>RendererInstruction</code> enum includes operations for <code>Push</code> and <code>Pop</code>. These instructions are important for rendering more complex shapes because they allow us to &quot;save&quot; the state of the renderer and go back to it later. As you probably guessed, the renderer states are &quot;saved&quot; by pushing them onto a stack using the <code>Push</code> instruction. We can then re-load that saved state by <code>Pop</code>ing from the stack.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#state" id="state">State</a></h3>
<p>Here's an example of how we can represent this state:</p>
<pre><code>struct State {
    position: turtle::Point,
    heading: turtle::Angle,
    step: u16,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>Crab</code> can use a <code>Vec&lt;State&gt;</code> as a stack. Whenever a <code>Push</code> instruction is executed, we capture the current state and push it onto the stack. Whenever a <code>Pop</code> instrution is executed, we'll pop a State from the stack and set the location, heading, etc. of our crab. Simple! Using <code>Push</code> and <code>Pop</code> instructions is what allows for some really complex and interesting images.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#why-stop-here" id="why-stop-here">Why stop here</a></h1>
<p>You have done something awesome! You have explored the wonderful world of
L-systems. You have created software to be able explore interesting aspects of
L-systems, parsers, interpreters and how they interact.</p>
<p>But known this is only a tip of the iceberg. There are a lot of things to
explore further. And this chapter is shining some light into the adventurous
world of exploration.</p>
<p>Don't take it as a travelers guide. We ourselves are as oblivious as the next
person when it comes to what you want to delve into. Feel free to follow your
own interest and amaze us with your thoughts and creations.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#more-rendering-instructions" id="more-rendering-instructions">More Rendering Instructions</a></h2>
<p>We're able to create some awesome drawings, even with our basic set of rendering instructions. There's a lot of additional instructions that we could add in order to create increasingly complex images. Some of these instructions may also imply additional values in the <code>RenderConfig</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructions to increase and decrease the <code>step</code>
<ul>
<li>The amount to increase/decrease can be a configurable <code>step_multiplier</code> in the <code>RenderConfig</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instructions to increase and decrease the <code>angle</code>
<ul>
<li>The amount to increase/decrease can be a configurable <code>angle_multiplier</code> in the <code>RenderConfig</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instructions to increase and decrease the line width
<ul>
<li>The renderer config should include a starting value for the line width</li>
<li>The amount to increase/decrease can be a configurable <code>line_width_multiplier</code> in the <code>RenderConfig</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instructions to change the pen color
<ul>
<li>The renderer config should include a starting value for the pen color</li>
<li>How you change this could be simple or very complex. You could have separate instructions for each of a limited number of colors (e.g. <code>SetPenColorRed</code>), or you could create instructions for manipulating RGBA values independently. This could quickly get pretty complex, but it could also allow for some fancy coloring!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#additional-renderer-configuration" id="additional-renderer-configuration">Additional Renderer Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Currently the parser for the <code>RenderConfig</code> only allows to define the step size and the angle. It may be good to add additional configuration items to support the new instructions suggested above.</p>
<p>Also, there's a lot of things you may want to configure more statically, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure the starting position and heading of the Crab</li>
<li>Configure the size of the canvas</li>
<li>Configure the background and pen colors</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#make-all-length-units-relative" id="make-all-length-units-relative">Make all length units relative</a></h2>
<p>Our current implementation uses pixels as the unit for all distances, since that's what the turtle crate uses. This makes it sensitive to different resolutions. We could instead make these units relative to the size of the window, so that the images look good regardless of the size of the window or monitor.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#parser-framework-1" id="parser-framework-1">Parser Framework</a></h2>
<p>Maybe you have discovered some recurring pattern while writing your parsers.
This is an ideal target for create your own combinators. Go back and examine
your code to see where some form of abstraction could be teased from it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#improved-interpreter" id="improved-interpreter">Improved Interpreter</a></h2>
<p>Currently the <code>Interpreter</code> returns the resulting word in one go, which requires storing the entire array of symbol productions in memory. You also have learned that words in L-systems can grow very quickly. This is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Instead of returning the word in it's entirety, you could return an iterator over the word. This allows some flexibility how to iterate over the words.</p>
<p>One other way is to use a stack with the parts of words to progress combined with the level of iteration. Once the level reached zero, we can push the symbols out.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#decouple-the-l-system-and-the-rendering" id="decouple-the-l-system-and-the-rendering">Decouple the L-system and the Rendering</a></h2>
<p>The L-system itself if just about symbol substitution. The symbols themselves don't have any intrinsic meaning. The fact that there's a <code>config:</code> section in our l-system file is less than ideal because it couples the interpreter and the renderer. Ideally, the two would be totally separate.</p>
<p>One idea to decouple these would be to write the interpreter and renderer as completely separate binaries. The interpreter would simply output a final sequence of symbols to stdout. The renderer would read a sequence of symbols from stdin and interpret them as rendering instructions. You could easily pipe the output of the interpreter into the renderer. This would make it really easy to try out different renderers for the same L-system!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#working-with-dependencies" id="working-with-dependencies">Working with Dependencies</a></h1>
<p>There are two different goals for this workshop. First is to allow you to play
with L-systems. Second is to allow you to code your own L-system, and then play
with that.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate that the code makes use of path dependencies. That way we
can easily transition from relying on provided code to relying on your own code.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mechanism" id="mechanism">Mechanism</a></h2>
<p>If you take a look at the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file you will notice the <code>[dependencies]</code>
table has a lot of path dependencies. E.g. we have a dependency on <code>parser</code>
which can be found at <code>examplar-parser</code>, according to the following snippet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
parser = { path = &quot;examplar-parser&quot; }
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#your-code" id="your-code">Your code</a></h3>
<p>Every <code>examplar-*</code> library has a regular counter-part. I.e. besides
<code>examplar-parser</code> there is also <code>parser</code> library. This library has some skeletal
code. It is an ideal starting ground for working on your own code.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hooking-up-your-code" id="hooking-up-your-code">Hooking up your code</a></h3>
<p>Once you are comfortable with your code, it is time to hook it up to the main
executable. This way you can play with your own L-system.</p>
<p>This is done by changing the top-level <code>Cargo.toml</code>. Specifically the
<code>[dependencies]</code> table. For the <code>[dependencies]</code> you need to point to the correct
path. E.g. for the parser dependency the path should be <code>parser</code> if you want to
use your own code. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#enjoy-your-l-system" id="enjoy-your-l-system">Enjoy your L-System</a></h3>
<p>If everything works out, you should be able to enjoy your own L-system
framework.</p>
